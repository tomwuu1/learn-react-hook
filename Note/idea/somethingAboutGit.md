#Git
I meet a problem when I want to use Github to record my learning to Reacord.  
Firstly, I want to fork [this repository](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), but it's not the development environment I want.  
Then, I run this command--`npx create-react-app my-app`
I found if I use Webstorm and I authentic it. I can pull different branches to the repository.
